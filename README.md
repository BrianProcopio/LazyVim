# My ðŸ’¤ LazyVim Configuration

I am using [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) with a little customization.

Be sure to backup your current NeoVim configuration before using this one:

```bash
mv ~/.config/nvim{,.bak}
mv ~/.local/share/nvim{,.bak}
mv ~/.local/state/nvim{,.bak}
mv ~/.cache/nvim{,.bak}
```
